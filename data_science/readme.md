###Data Science

#### The Story:

Me learning data science (from scratch) from a Udacity course in order to work on my hackathon project for PennApps W2014.

PennApps W2014 was held over valentines day, and I had been conveniently been nominated to do a random act of kindness on this day.
I decided to give out hugs to random hackers throughout the day, and I collected a data set of my hug success rate over time with respect to social situations.

I also had been interested in learning data science anyways, so I saw this as an opportunity to learn how to manipulate (supposedly big) data and apply those techniques to my hugs data set. 

This is the me-learning-data-science-part of my PennApps hack.

Infatuated with the idea of god-like productivity at hackathons, I drasticallly underestimated how long it would take to go from zero to hero in data science, and unfortauntely I did not finish during the duration of the hackathon.

Here's my pledge to keep learning though and hopefully have a functioning hack after finishing the course within a few weeks (after I finish my midterms this coming week!)
