###Data Science

#### The Story:

Me learning data science (from scratch) from a UdaCity course in order to work on my hackathon project for PennApps W2014.

PennApps W2014 was held over valentines day, and I had been conveniently been nominated to do a random act of kindness on this day.
I decided to give out hugs to random hackers throughout the day, and I collected a data set of my hug success rate over time with respect to social situations.

I also had been interested in learning data science anyways, so I saw this as an opportunity to learn how to manipulate (supposedly big) data and apply those techniques to my hugs data set.

This is the me-learning-data-science-part of my PennApps hack.
